### Project Overview
*The intent of this project is two-fold:* 

xx

 - **Part One** - Involves exploratory data analysis of crime incidents throughout Washington, DC from July 2018 - 2019. The analysis will involve mappings of crime incidents within the city, crime volumes by certain time and day parameters, as well as crime incidents by geographical dimensions, i.e., DC Wards. 
 

 - **Part Two** - Involves the classification of the type of crime to take place given a number of feature variables. In the case of crime data provided by the DC Government through their open data initiatives, a crime incident is categorized into one of the following classes: 
     - Arson
     - Assault with A Dangerous Weapon
     - Burglary
     - Homicide
     - Motor Vehicle Theft
     - Robbery
     - Sex Abuse
     - Theft From Automobiles
     - Theft (Other)
 
For both parts, we'll walk through the methods used for obtaining, cleaning, analyzing, conditioning, feature engineering, and modeling the data.
