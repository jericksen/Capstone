### Project Overview
*The intent of this project is two-fold:* 

> - **Part One** - Involves exploratory data analysis of crime incidents throughout Washington, DC from July 2018 - 2019. The analysis will involve mappings of crime incidents within the city, crime volumes by certain time and day parameters, as well as crime incidents by geographical dimensions, i.e., DC Wards. 
 

> - **Part Two** - Involves the classifying the type of crime that takes place given a number of feature variables. The DC Police Department recognizes instances of crime as one of the following classes:
     - Arson
     - Assault with A Dangerous Weapon
     - Burglary
     - Homicide
     - Motor Vehicle Theft
     - Robbery
     - Sex Abuse
     - Theft From Automobiles
     - Theft (Other)
The modeling portion will focus on identifying the best algorithm to classify the type of crime that took place. The problem we're trying to solve is whether or not a model can predict the type of crime with a reasonable accuracy score with the data provided by the DC police department. The implications of a successful model could feasibly assist the police department with allocating the appropriate resources as soon as as soon as a crime is to occur to reduce the

For both parts, we'll walk through the methods used for obtaining, cleaning, analyzing, conditioning, feature engineering, and modeling the data.
